# Agar I/O

Agar I/O is my own version of the classic online game Agar.io, built to run in the terminal.

In Agar I/O, you play as a cell fighting for its survival.
You can grow in size by eating agar or consuming smaller cells.
Be careful though, as larger cells want to grow as well. Stay away to avoid being eaten!

## How to install

1. Download the build through GitHub Releases
2. Open the executable in the ``publish`` folder (`.exe` on windows, no extension on MacOS and Linux)
